# contree-server-1

My very first try of implementing a server to ~play La Contr√©e~.
Ideally I wanted to aim to make a server for a game, but the first goal would be to get familiar with all the dev stuff.

## Roadmap

* Setting up a project with Node, Typescript, yarn, VsCode, linter, prettier, ...
* Have a documented process for all these tools to be intalled (this README.md)
* Be able to get the source code to edit/update it cleanly (github, VsCode, linter, prettier)
* Have a process to build, test and run the code, in debug & release mode (yarn, jest)
* Make the project deployable, choose a platform (linux vitual machine) and update this documentation

## Setup Notes

* Xcode and the dev tools
* iTerm2
  * Template for `bash_profile`: https://www.dropbox.com/s/e0hycjain4nd9ka/cbr-tr-bash-profile.txt?dl=0
* brew
* yarn
* VsCode

## Dev Notes

* Run `yarn install`
